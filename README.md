# server-configurations
A collection of commands which I used to configure server. Just for a backup and common place to look in future.
# Digital ocean

cd /var/www/html
```
# Vagrant
```shell
vagrant init #initialize vagrant in new directory
vagrant up
vagrant reload --prvision #run this after updating yaml file
vagrant ssh
```
